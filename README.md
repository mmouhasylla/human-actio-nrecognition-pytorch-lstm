# Human Action Recognition Pytorch LSTM
- In this repository, you'll find different notebook, one of them is trained using the MHAD dataset and train my LSTM model... 
- Instead of feeding raw images to our model, we will feed it time series like data, more precisely. We used openpose on a dataset of images, while it was generating the images with the skeleton overlay on it 

As you can see on the image below, we have a tenisman

Now after running openpose on this image, we have:
